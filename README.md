# Equatorial-mount
equatorial mount with smart vision system and auto calibration.  

The vision system is made up of a pi-camera connected to a raspberry-pi model B with auto-calibration using two step-motors (one for x and the other one for y axis). 
The vision system is made up to detect and track the moon using a Haar-cascade model that I trained from positive(containing the moon) and negative images (not containing the moon).
